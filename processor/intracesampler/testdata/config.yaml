    # hash_seed allows one to configure the hashing seed. This is important in
    # scenarios where multiple layers of collectors are used to achieve the
    # desired sampling rate, eg.: 10% on first layer and 10% on the
    # second, resulting in an overall sampling rate of 1% (10% x 10%).
    # If all layers use the same seed, all data passing one layer will also pass
    # the next one, independent of the configured sampling rate. Having different
    # seeds at different layers ensures that sampling rate in each layer work as
    # intended.
